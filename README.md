# WELCOME to a _VERY_ Friendly Introduction to GitHub :

Heard of GitHub but don't think it's relevant to your world?  Did you know it can actually be used as a pretty powerful project management tool that doesn't require coding or a command line interface?  Let us show you how to use GitHub to manage programs and projects with no pre-requisite knowledge required in this *Friendly Introduction to GitHub workshop*.

During this 4-hour workshop we will:
* provide examples of how this flexible tool can be used for managing all sorts of collaborative projects 
* show you how to create a website
* demystify the lingo and processes built into this online platform
* provide time for hands-on activities and small-group work where we will create repositories, work with labels, set milestones and assign tasks
* look at the tools complementary to GitHub such as gh-pages and gitbook

#### BEFORE THE WORKSHOP
1. If you don't already have a **GitHub account**, please sign up for one now: 
  * Go to Github.com.  
  * Click on the "Sign Up" link in the upper right-hand corner. 
  * Create a user name and enter your email address and a password.
  * Click on the green "Create an account" button.
  * Select the "Unlimited public repositories for free" option if not already selected then click the green "Continue" button.
  * You can choose whether or not to answer the questions on the next page or click the blue link for "Skip this step".
  * At this point you need to verify the email address by going in to the email account you registered and following the verification instructions.  
  
Feel free to create a new project and/or look around.  Don't worry, you won't break anything.  You'll become more familiar with GitHub and the interface during the workshop.

2. Please take 5 minutes or so to respond to our [**pre-workshop survey**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSft9j-VxZdqszo747JBtigIggkWDoe17H8SrYj12IpR6NK7Fg/viewform?usp=sf_link).  Your responses will help us tailor the workshop experience as much as we can to accommodate the different needs of participants.

3. Checklist of what to **bring with you**:
  * Laptop
  * Power cord for said laptop (we will have power available at the tables)
  * Your creativity and experimental mindset.
  
4. Take a look at the [**RDAP Code of Conduct**](http://www.asis.org/rdap/code-of-conduct/), we'll be operating under that CoC throughout the workshop to help ensure an inclusive, cooperative environment for all participants.

### Oh, by the way, what's Mozilla Science Lab?? 
At [Mozilla Science Lab](https://science.mozilla.org/) we help scientists and researchers (anyone from students to established researchers to librarians to citizen scientists) to work openly and do better research, more research, and make that research more useful by sharing it widely.

We organize various types of events & trainings (such as this workshop and the [Working Open Workshops](https://mozillascience.github.io/WOW-2017/)), develop learning materials and formats (such as [Mozilla Study Groups](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups) and other [resources](https://science.mozilla.org/resources)), host platforms for sharing and showcasing open Science projects (such as [MSL Projects](https://science.mozilla.org/projects)), and provide support for leaders in open science (through the [Mozilla Fellows for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships)).

### Want to get involved?
Mozilla Science Lab provides several opportunities to get engaged with the open science community.  
**DIAL-IN:** [Community calls](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab/Calls) are open for everyone to join and take place the second Thursday of every other month.  
**BROWSE RESOURCES:** Find learning materials and resources to grow your skills and those of your community.  Our [Resources](https://science.mozilla.org/resources) page has all sorts of materials from handbooks to how-to guides.  
**JOIN A GROUP:** If you’re located at an academic institution, you can join a [Study Group](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups) to share skills, experiences, and ideas around open science, open source, code, and community in research.  Don’t see one at your institution? [Start one!](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups/run)  Study Group calls are monthly calls used as opportunities to network and are open to everyone, so feel free to join a call to see what it’s like before jumping in.  
**CONTRIBUTE TO A PROJECT:** Want to dig in on some open science projects?  Check out a [curated list of projects](https://science.mozilla.org/projects) from our community members.  All of these open source projects provide README and CONTRIBUTING files that detail how to get started as a contributor.  
**FOLLOW US:** Our [blog](https://science.mozilla.org/blog) and [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/MozillaScience) will keep you up-to-date on other events as they come up such as our Global Sprint, Fellowship calls, and in-person or online learning opportunities.  You can also subscribe to our [monthly newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/sciencelab) with news from the open source and scientific community.
