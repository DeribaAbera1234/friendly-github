Greetings **Participant first name**!

We're excited to work with you during the upcoming Friendly Introduction to GitHub workshop.

We have a few requests of you ahead of time.

1. If you don't already have a **GitHub account**, please sign up for one now: 
  * Go to Github.com.  
  * Click on the "Sign Up" link in the upper right-hand corner. 
  * Create a user name and enter your email address and a password.
  * Click on the green "Create an account" button.
  * Select the "Unlimited public repositories for free." option if not already selected then click the green "Continue" button.
  * You can choose whether or not to answer the questions on the next page or click the blue link for "Skip this step".
  * At this point you need to verify the email address by going in to the email account you registered and following the verification instructions.  
  
Feel free to create a new project and/or look around.  Don't worry, you won't break anything.  You'll become more familiar with GitHub and the interface during the workshop.

2. Please take 5 minutes or so to respond to our **pre-workshop survey**.  Your responses will help us tailor the workshop experience as much as we can to accommodate the different needs of participants.

3. Checklist of what to **bring with you**:
  * Laptop
  * Power cord for said laptop (we will have power available at the tables)
  * Your creativity and experimental mindset.
  
That's it for now!

We'll see you in Seattle!

Your Instructors:
Danielle, Jessica, Steph & Steve
